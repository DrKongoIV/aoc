# Advent of Code 2021 in Rust

This year, I decided to solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) puzzles to learn the basics of Rust ðŸ¦€.

Usage: 
```sh
cargo run --bin <puzzle>
```
where `<puzzle>` is a string like `08_a` or `15_b`.
The puzzle input is expected from standard input.
